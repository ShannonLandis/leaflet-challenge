Module15 Challenge USGS earthquake map

This challenge reads earthquake data from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php filtered to previous day.

The data is then plotted on a geo map with the size of the circle plot relative to the magnitude and the color relative to the depth of the earthquake.
